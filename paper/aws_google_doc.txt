a. The Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud
    Amazon provides a collection of remote computing services called Amazon Web Services (AWS). One of the most central and well-known of these services is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). EC2 allows for the configuration and use of virtual servers, or compute instances, at any capacity desired. In contrast with the up-front research and costs necessary to purchase an in-house computing solution, EC2 offers the flexibility to utilize a wide range of computing capacity with a "pay-as-you-go" model. This framework makes it possible to optimize one's computing power and budget for their application

i. Instances and AMIs
    EC2 offers virtual servers called "instances", which users can configure, start, and securely log in to use. These instances are based on operating system "templates" called Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Users can choose thousands of different AMIs from the AWS or community marketplaces to launch instances of in EC2. Additionally, users can create their own customized AMIs for private or public use.
    An important step in the instance configuration process is choosing the underlying hardware. EC2 offers a range of "instance types" for different use cases. Instance types include "general purpose" instances, with low to moderate computing power, "compute optimized" instances that have a higher quantity of fast virtual CPUs, "memory optimized" instances containing large amounts of RAM, "storaged optimized" instances for high data I/O throughput and capacity, and GPU instances.
